## Text Editor

I came as an outsider to the world of software development. With that, I learned the hard way about the importance of an IDE for writing software. I used to write my Java course work code in Notepad, and eventually upgraded to [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and was finally introduced to [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/) in more advanced Java classes. 

My first professional gig had me writing in a proprietary coding language where the workflow was taught in [EMACs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). I became quite proficint with Emacs, but I viewed it as an antiquated, yet powerful (split-panes, copy full-lines of text, and side-by-side line-by-line file compares were my sticky features), base text editor for engineering folk; similar to [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) or [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/); great for remote file editing on servers, but not a robust development tool. *(In 2017, I was floored by another dev actively using Emacs for his entire dev process through extensive editor configuration, **that** was a mind bender :)*

Probably around 2013, after mastering an Emacs workflow while on my first dev job, I started to look for better tooling for the craft. That's when I discovered [Sublime Text][sublime] and fell in love with a text editor. I was able to keep all of the sticky features from my Emacs days, but added in multi-cursors (huge workflow boon) and a versatile extension library (sftp, quick apply syntax highlighters, linters). For that point on, I have spent countless hours working in Sublime and didn't have any desire or reason to deviate...

In 2017, I started reskilling as an engineer and focused in on JavaScript as a core, versatile language. When working on colaborative JS projects, I started using Github extensively as my collaborative VCS (I had previously been using [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/) for professional colllaboration). Proper [Github Workflows](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) kept the development in order, but my workflow was in need of tightening. I used this opportunity to pick up the relatively new, [Visual Studio Code][code], as a text editor and I have found it to be the most sticky editor yet! (Intgration of file explorer, git dashboard, and bash terminal are seamless)
